### Python Implementaion of Huffman Coding

Consists **compress** and **decompress** function.


#### Testing / Running the program

1 Save / Clone the above repository
2 The repository consists of a sample text file of size 715kB
3 Run the python code `useHuffman.py` to compress & decompress the given sample file


To run the code for any other file, edit the `path` variable in the `useHuffman.py` file.


For now, the *decompress()* function is to be called from the same object from which the *compress()* function was called, for compressing-decompressing a file (as the encoding information is stored in the data members of the object only)
